class IDeviceIntegration {
     public:
         virtual void connect() = 0;
         virtual void fetchData() = 0;
     };

Here you see a class, but dont see any variables or functions with definition
in the class, such a thing in OO is called as interface It will act
like a contract to enforce something on a class, example.

class HeartRateMonitor : public IDeviceIntegration {
     public:
         void connect() override {
             // Implementation for connecting to heart rate monitor
         }
         void fetchData() override {
             // Implementation for fetching heart rate data
         }
     };

class HeartRateMonitor : public IDeviceIntegration , This line should
be read as HeartRateMonitor is a realizaation of the interface IdeviceIntegration.
