/*
In C++, `int&& rref = 20;` declares an **rvalue reference** named `rref` that refers to an integer literal `20`. 
Let's break down what this means:

1. **Rvalue Reference (`int&&`)**:
   - The `int&&` syntax represents an rvalue reference.
   - An rvalue reference is used to bind to temporary (rvalue) objects.
   - It allows you to extend the lifetime of temporary objects.
   - Rvalue references are commonly used for move semantics and perfect forwarding.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `rref` is initialized with the value `20`.
   - Since `20` is an rvalue (a temporary value), it can be bound to an rvalue reference.

3. **Lifetime Extension**:
   - The lifetime of the temporary value `20` is extended to match the lifetime of `rref`.
   - This allows you to use `rref` as if it were a regular variable.

In summary, `int&& rref = 20;` creates an rvalue reference `rref` that refers to the temporary value `20`. Rvalue references are powerful tools for efficient resource management and move semantics in C++. 🚀👨‍💻
